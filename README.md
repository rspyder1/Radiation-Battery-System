## 🔋 Overview

The Hybrid Radiation Battery is a conceptual power generation system that harnesses energy from radioactive decay — specifically beta particle emissions and decay heat — to produce continuous electricity. The system is designed with passive safety, durability, and scalability in mind, making it a candidate for space missions, remote bases, and deep-earth infrastructure.

## ⚙️ Core Technology

- **Betavoltaics:** Capture beta particles to generate electricity.
- **Thermoelectrics:** Convert decay heat into usable power via the Seebeck effect.
- **Shielding:** Lead or tungsten encasement for safety and isolation.
- **Magnetic Control (Optional):** Improve electron collection efficiency.

## 🧠 Scientific Basis

This concept uses existing principles in nuclear physics and thermoelectric conversion. It does not rely on speculative or future technologies for its core functionality.

## 🧬 Future Quantum Hypothesis

A speculative research path included in the white paper explores the idea of using quantum entanglement to reduce or suppress radioactive emissions. While not required for this battery's function, it opens intriguing directions for long-term innovation.
